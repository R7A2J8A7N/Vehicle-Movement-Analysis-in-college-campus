# Vehicle-Movement-Analysis-in-College-Campus

## Introduction
This repository hosts a machine learning model built with YOLOv5 for detecting vehicles and their number plates in images and video streams. The model achieves high accuracy and is adaptable for various domains including traffic management, security systems, and more.

## Features
Vehicle Detection: Accurately identifies cars and other vehicles in images and video.  
Number Plate Recognition: Extracts and reads number plates from detected vehicles.  
High Accuracy: Achieves robust performance in detecting vehicles and recognizing number plates.  
Versatility: Suitable for deployment across different applications and environments.  
Automatic Record Keeping: The identified number plates are stored in a csv file.  

## Installations
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
opencv-python  
jupyter  
labelImg  
You can install these packages using pip  

## Usage
The model can be deployed in various real-life scenarios:  

Traffic Management: Monitor and analyze vehicle movements in real-time.  
Security Systems: Enhance surveillance capabilities by detecting vehicles and identifying number plates.  
Smart Parking Solutions: Automate entry and exit management in parking facilities.

## Model Training (YOLOv5)
The project makes use of yoloV5 model.   
YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It primarily utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) as its underlying algorithm. It is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive optimization algorithms like Adam, to minimize the combined loss function.
